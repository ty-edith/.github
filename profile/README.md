# Verkligt â€“ The Independent Digital Rights Platform
Verkligt is an independent digital platform that connects creators, rightsholders, organisations, and users of creative works.
Our aim is to make it easier to find, claim, and manage copyright royalties, and to give organisations simple tools for handling unclaimed payments and contact requests.

## What Verkligt Does
* Search for unclaimed royalties by name or work
* Verify identity via BankID and submit claims
* Register works for future royalties
* Enable licensing contact between creators and users

## Our Vision
To be the natural digital hub in a fragmented copyright landscape â€“ one place for rightsholders to manage their rights, and for organisations to connect with them.

## Status
Verkligt is currently in early development. More information, including API documentation, will be published at a later stage.
